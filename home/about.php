<h1>About Us </h1>
<br>
<p>e-File Tracking System (e-FTS) is a web based application which helps in tracking
the movement of files and receipts. The application enables the users to maintain a
consistent watch over the movement of various important documents in the process of
decision-making. It was felt that a system is required to monitor the movement of Files
and Receipts at different levels in the decision making process. To fulfill the requirement,
a thorough study was conducted of the existing system. It was decided that the system
should be a lightweight application requiring minimal inputs and user-friendly interface.
The system has been designed in such a manner that the controlling officer of an
organization/division/section can view the movement of the documents and could take
appropriate decisions. This has been achieved by putting rigorous efforts while designing
of the database for the application. </p>
